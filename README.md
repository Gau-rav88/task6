Subqueries:

          A subquery is a query inside another query.
          It helps when one question needs the answer of another question first.


Subquery Examples:
   
              (a) Subquery in WHERE(This type of subquery is used to filter data.)
              (b) IN Subquery(This is used when the subquery returns multiple values.)
              (c) Correlated Subquery(A correlated subquery depends on the outer query.)
              (d) EXISTS Subquery(EXISTS is used to check if a subquery returns at least one row.)
              (e) Subquery in SELECT(This type of subquery is written inside the SELECT part to display an extra calculated value.)
              (f) Subquery in FROM (It is used when you want to calculate something first and then apply conditions on that result.)
